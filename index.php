        <h3>Welcome to Oceanic HRIS</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>Announcement:</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Oceanic Container Lines, Inc. (OCLI) was incorporated in July 22, 1998 and it's a reflection of a vast treasury of shipping expertise engraved by years and years of field experience, 
            thus permeating a badge of excellence identifying its management.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>With almost fourteen years of experience in liner business, 
            OCLI brought to existence a healthy organization ready, potent, and anxious to make a mark in the shipping industry.
            Its present and progressive position is secured upon these two contrasting and yet complementary elements, 
            the organization's infancy in years and yet its maturity to provide clients with all cargo shipping requirements, 
            making it threat to all other competitors and a sure leader in the field of containerized cargo shipping.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Firmly entrenched upon the vision of excellence,
            Oceanic offers unequalled integrated services not found in the other containerized shipping organizations.
            At present, it has twelve reliable and fully containerized vessels, M/V Ocean Quest, M/V Ocean Hope, M/V Ocean Faith, M/V Ocean Prosperity, 
            M/V Ocean Nobility, M/V Ocean Blessing, M/V Ocean Serenity, M/V Ocean Victory, M/V Ocean Unity, M/V Ocean Mighty, M/V Ocean Challenger,
            and M/V Ocean Excellence, journeying Manila, Davao, General Santos, Zamboanga, Cagayan de Oro, Bacolod, Iloilo, Dumaguete, and Cebu, 
            primed by fully capacitated and highly integrated subsidiaries, Discovery Haulers, Inc., Lorship Trucking Corporation, 
            and Pioneer Logistics and Rental Corporation.</p>
